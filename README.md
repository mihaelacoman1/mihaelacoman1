🙋‍♀️ Welcome to Miha's GitHub 🙋‍♀

🎓 Currently in my final year of studies in Computer Science and Economic Informatics at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies.
🧠 About to graduate in 2026, with dual specialization in Business & IT: blending technical skills with management insight.
🧩 Ask me about:
Product Management — bridging users, developers and value; turning ideas into real solutions.
Image Processing — extracting meaning from pixels; I love working with visual data.
Front-End Development — creating intuitive, aesthetic, and responsive web interfaces.
💬 I started studying programming in the first year of high school.
6 years later, after countless sleepless nights and deadlines, I love it even more — in all its forms.
